  <div>Where No One Has Gone Before: The First Metadata Set of the World's Largest Fanfiction
      Repository</div>

  <div class="section-subtitle">Abstract:</div>
  <p>With its roots dating to popular television shows of the 1960s
    such as Star Trek, fanfiction has blossomed into an extremely popular form of creative
    expression. The transition from printed zines to online fanfiction repositories has
    facilitated this growth in popularity, with millions of fans writing stories and adding to
    sites such as Fanfiction.net each day. Enthusiasts are sharing their writing, reading
    stories written by others, and helping each other to grow as writers. Yet, this domain is
    often undervalued by society and understudied by researchers. Fanfiction.net, the worldâ€™s
    largest fanfiction repository, has never been systematically studied. The corpus is large
    and growing. In this paper, we present the first full release of all Fanfiction.net
    metadata. We use visual analytics techniques to draw several intriguing insights from the
    data and show the potential for future research. We have also made the open source
    database of raw metadata available so that other researchers can explore further
    questions related to online fanfiction communities.</p>

  <p>All data entries are anonymized so that works cannot be traced back
    and associated to the individual that produced it. The information we're releasing contains
    only the metadata of the stories published on FanFiction.net. The following is an exhaustive
    list of the data that will be available.</p>
